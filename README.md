The [@devcontainers-community]'s mission is to be a **centralized source** for
**well-maintained** features that are of **high-quality** similar to those of
the official [@devcontainers] organization, but for more **popular tools and
languages**.

We want to avoid atrophy by investing into the _community-based_ approach to
maintenance that has been successful in other communtiy orgainzations like
[@asdf-community]. This means making it as easy as possible to contribute. ü§ù

This is, however, a _fallback option_ for languages and tools that do not have
official awesome-tool/devcontainer-features or related repositories to
self-maintain within that community. If you are an individual who is part of a
popular tool, consider [authoring your own feature repository]! ‚ù§Ô∏è

If you're interested in joining this organization, that's awesome! ü§© Open a
Discussion and let's chat! If you just want to add a new feature, check out our
[feature contribution guide]! üåü

## Scope

Here's some specific examples of things that are in scope for this organization:

- Maintaining popular language features, ~~images~~ _maybe later_, and templates
  that [@devcontainers] does not cover
- Onboarding existing trusted community members who have maintained devcontainer
  features, ~~images~~ _maybe later_, or templates
- ~~Highlighting good community-authored documentation, features, images,
  templates, and other content through an awesome list~~ _maybe at a later date_

Besides these core goals, there's some other important things that are
deliberatly omitted from the scope, and are better tackled elsewhere:

- Writing or maintaining devcontainer-related documentation. This is best done
  by individuals, but can be highlighted in an awesome list.
- Maintaining forked versions of the official [@devcontainers] projects. If you
  can improve the official product, that's better than a community fork!
- Maintaining custom versions of existing officially provided
  awesome-tool/devcontainer-thing projects from other organizations like
  [rocker-org/devcontainer-features]. They've graciously taken on the
  maintenance burden themselves, and we don't want to splinter the community. ‚ù§Ô∏è
