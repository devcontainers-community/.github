The [@devcontainers-community]'s mission is to be a **centralized source** for
**community-maintained** features, templates, images, etc. that are of
**high-quality** similar to those of the official [@devcontainers] organization,
but for **additional popular tools, languages, environments, etc.**

We want to avoid atrophy by investing into the _community-based_ approach to
maintenance that has been successful in other communtiy orgainzations like
[@asdf-community]. This means making it as easy as possible to contribute. ü§ù

This is, however, a _fallback option_ for languages and tools that do not have
official awesome-tool/my-feature or related repositories to self-maintain within
that community. If you are an individual who is part of a popular tool, consider
[authoring your own feature repository]! ‚ù§Ô∏è

If you're interested in joining this organization, that's awesome! ü§© Open a
Discussion and let's chat! If you just want to add a new feature, check out our
[feature contribution guide]! üåü

## Scope

Here's some specific examples of things that are in scope for this organization:

- Maintaining popular language features, images, and templates that
  [@devcontainers] does not cover.
- Adding existing community members who have are interested in or maintain Dev
  Container things.
- Highlighting good community-authored documentation, features, images,
  templates, and other content through an awesome list.

Besides these core goals, there's some other important things that are
deliberatly omitted from the scope, and are better tackled elsewhere:

- Writing or maintaining Dev Container-related documentation. This is best done
  by individuals, but can be highlighted in an [awesome list].
- Maintaining forked versions of the official [@devcontainers] projects. If you
  can improve the official product, that's better than a community fork!
- Maintaining custom versions of existing officially provided
  awesome-tool/devcontainer-thing projects from other organizations like
  [rocker-org/devcontainer-features]. ‚ù§Ô∏è
